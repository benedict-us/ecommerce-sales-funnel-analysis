## 🚀 About Me 
I'm a Product Analyst passionate about helping businesses turn data into better products and smarter decisions. I specialize in analyzing user behavior, tracking product performance, and building dashboards that guide strategy and optimize outcomes. I enjoy automating reporting, uncovering insights from complex datasets, and creating models that help teams plan for growth.

I work with tools like SQL Server, Excel, and Power BI to translate data into actionable insights, and I’m currently learning to use Google’s BigQuery to handle even larger datasets and unlock deeper insights. I thrive on collaborating with teams to improve product experiences.

When I'm not working with data, I enjoy jogging, reading, following sports, exploring nature, and diving into anime. I thrive on those “aha!” moments when data tells a story that drives meaningful impact.
